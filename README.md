# Motivation of the work
Understanding consumer behavior and preventing fraud are crucial components of improving profitability and cost control in the competitive business world of today. The project's primary goal is to apply various machine learning algorithm and data mining techniques towards addressing some few difficulties which may affect commercial organizations, including sentiment analysis, fraud detection, cost calculation, and customer rating concerns. Thus, this work is invaluable for improving fraud detection and analysis of customer behavior to improve customers’ financial situation and improve their overall satisfaction.

# Classification Method
A supervised learning technique called classification uses labelled data to teach an algorithm how to categorise unknown data into predetermined classes. Like how product categories are classified, Naïve Bayes along with random forest which is utilized within such learning to determine sentiment categories of customer reviews.

Regression Method: The regression method is another machine learning approach used to categorize dependent variables according to their input factors. Linear Regression and KNN models are used in this project to predict costs for each considerable numerical data from customer ratings and
product-related features.

Text Analytics: The project focuses on text analysis which is crucial where customer feedback is assessed with a view of classifying it as either positive, negative, or even neutral. By
using machine learning models, the changes in customer feedback can be directly identified and businesses can address the issues at the soonest time possible and improve the customer experience in the process.

Unsupervised Machine Learning: Cluster analysis involves sorting similar data based on a distance or similarity measure. One of the methods used in unsupervised learning, K-Means Clustering.

Rule Mining Association: During information discovery, rule mining association is a technique which can be drawn to specifically find correlations between variables in the dataset at hand. This is often done with the help of the Apriori Algorithm that finds frequent itemsets relevant to a certain support.

# Research Objectives

Research Objective 1: To assess customer ratings and related characteristics regarding entities and put them into certain categories. The purpose of evaluating customer ratings and similar attributes is to segment entities about customers’ preferences, opinions, and actions. Business organizations can discover patterns that associate ratings generated by customers with attributes of products or services including quality, services offered, and prices.

Research Objective 2: To predict cost values using customer ratings as well as any other numerical value that may be associated with an item. The objective involves making estimates of cost using data such as customer ratings together with other quantitative data like price, quantity, or features.

Research Objective 3: To analyse sentiment and categorise the customer reviews to gain an understanding of them. The determination for this inspection objective is to distinguish consumer feedback into three categories: neutral, negative, and positive attitudes using sentiment analysis techniques. This approach is helpful since it may help businesses achieve greater insight into the perceived value their products or services have to customers.

Research Objective 4: To cluster transactions to discover possible anomalies in terms of temporal patterns. The purpose of this objective relates to the identification of time-related patterns in transaction grouping to identify symptoms of anomalous behaviour. Holders of business can therefore use the temporal analysis of transactions to detect the outliers, do fraud detection, and more importantly comprehend the customer purchasing pattern over the period, thus enhancing the decision and risk management.

Research Objective 5: To identify correlations within or between the attributes of transactions for improved fraud identification. One of the essential objectives is because it focuses on intra and inter-attribute dependencies of attributes like location, amount, time, and customer history to find out co-relation which may indicate fraud.
